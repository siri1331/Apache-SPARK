Supervised- The computer is taught by example
Unsupervised - The computer is expected to learn by itself

Why ML in Spark?

Why not scikit-learn, pandas, numpy - DASK integrates these libraries with distributed systems

Data Exploration vs Data Transformation

ML Life cycle:
Problem definition : Define bussiness vision and evaluation metric
Data Exploration: 
Handle missing values---> remove them or replace them
Create Visualizations between multiple variables for replationships
Identify any outliers in data -- remove them or treat them differently

Data Transformation:
Encoding categorical variables
Normalization: 0 to 1 or specific range

Model Training:
Split data into train and validation
Train the model on the training data

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using Validation dataset on trained model

Model Tuning:
Changing Model parameters that can optimize the performance
