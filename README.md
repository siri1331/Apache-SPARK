The project includes the [documentation](Documentation) of requirements for building Machine Learning Pipelines performing stages like Data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Label Encoding and One Hot encoding, Vectorizing the input, buildingML model and Performance tuning using CrossValidation and GridSeachCV.

1. [RegressionModel](RegressionModel) - using Linear Regressor 
2. [ClassificationModel](ClassificationModel) - using DecisionTree Classifier 

Both the projects involve in building stages in pipeline.
The stages include 
1. Data Pre-processing like handling null values and mapping the categorical values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis involving Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
3. Label Encoding and OneHot Encoding appropriate columns
4. Vectoring the input columns for implementing ML model
5. Training and building the Regression and Classification Model
6. Performance tuning the model parameters using Cross validation and GridSearchCV
7. Evaluating the model parameters on different metrics like r2 in Regression model and areaUnderROC for Classification model as the inputis imbalanced.
